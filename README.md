# async_mpe

For reference, these are two other implementations of the mpe environments (surprisingly, there are a few bugs in both implementations)

- Repo with code optimizations and jit compilation:
    https://github.com/IouJenLiu/PIC/tree/master/multiagent-particle-envs/multiagent

- Pettingzoo repo: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo/tree/master/pettingzoo/mpe
    
We took our implementations from the Edinburgh's group:
